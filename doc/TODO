The following functionality should be implemented:

* Full status updated every second:
 - general status (errors)
 - overtemperature
 - fuse tripped
 - for each instrument (channel) the following information should be available:
   -- mode of operation (voltage current)
   -- measured current and voltage
   -- status of autput (on/off)
* Support for all common commands
* Setting voltage and current for each instrument
* Setting output on/off for each instrument
* Support for SYSTEM subsystem commands with exception of the following:
   -- system:beeper
   -- system:version

Optionally:
 * support for the voltage protection subsystem

Not needed:
 * APPLY subsystem
